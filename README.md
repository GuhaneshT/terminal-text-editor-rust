Rope-Based Text Editor
A lightweight, terminal-based text editor written in Rust, utilizing a rope data structure for efficient text manipulation. This editor is designed for developers who prefer a minimal, keyboard-driven interface with fast performance for handling large text files.
Features

Rope Data Structure: Efficiently handles large text files with low memory overhead and fast insertions/deletions.
Terminal Interface: Built with crossterm for a cross-platform, terminal-based UI.
Keybindings: Intuitive keybindings for common editing tasks (e.g., save, undo, redo, cursor movement).
Help Menu: Interactive help menu displaying all keybindings, accessible via Ctrl+M.
Undo/Redo: Support for undoing and redoing changes.
Custom Filename: Set custom filenames for saving files.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
